Some examples for maze generation algorithms using Java

# Files
'Cell.java' and 'Cross.java' are the basic components used for the algorithsm
'Graph_RB.java' and 'Graph_RD.java' contains the GUI and the main methods
'Recursive_Backtrack.java' and 'Recursive_Division.java' are where the algorithms locate
