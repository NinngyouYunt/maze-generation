Some examples for maze generation algorithms using Java

### Files
`Cell.java` and `Cross.java` are the basic components used for the algorithsm
`Graph_RB.java` and `Graph_RD.java` contains the GUI and the main methods
`Recursive_Backtrack.java` and `Recursive_Division.java` are where the algorithms locate

### Additional Resources
Some good resources I used while developing this
[Think Labyrinth: Maze Algorithms](http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/algrithm.htm "List of algorithms and description")
[Buckblog: Maze Generation: Algorithm Recap](http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/3/maze-generation-sidewinder-algorithm "More detailed explaination and some exmaple code (not in Java)")
